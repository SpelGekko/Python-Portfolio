## Automation Script

Basic automation script to automate a repetitive task.

### Summary

This script performs two main tasks:

1. **PDF Merger**: Merges multiple PDF files into a single PDF file.
2. **Text File Analyzer**: Analyzes a text file to provide the following information:
   - Character count
   - Word count
   - Word frequency (top 10 most common words)

To use the script, place the PDF files and text file in the `files` directory and run the script. The merged PDF will be saved in the `files` directory, and the text file analysis results will be printed to the console.
